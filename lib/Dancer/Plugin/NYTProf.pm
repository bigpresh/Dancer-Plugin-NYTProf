=head1 NAME

Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf - easy Devel::NYTProf profiling for Dancer apps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A plugin to provide easy profiling for Dancer applications, using the venerable
L<Devel::NYTProf>.

By simply loading this plugin, you'll have the detailed, helpful profiling
provided by Devel::NYTProf.

Each individual request to your app is profiled.  Going to the URL
C</nytprof> in your app will present a list of profiles; selecting one will
invoke C<nytprofhtml> to generate the HTML reports (unless they already exist),
then serve them up.

B<WARNING> This is an early version of this code which is still in development.
In general this isn't a plugin I'd advise to use in a production environment
anyway, but in particular, it uses C<system> to execute C<nytprofhtml>, and I
need to very carefully re-examine the code to make sure that user input cannot
be used to nefarious effect.  You are recommended to only use this in your
development environment.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The plugin will work by default without any configuration required - it will
default to writing profiling data into a dir named C<profdir> within your Dancer
application's C<appdir>, present profiling output at C</nytprof> (not yet
configurable), and profile all requests.

Below is an example of the options you can configure:

    plugins:
        NYTProf:
            enabled: 1
            profdir: '/tmp/profiledata'
            nytprofhtml_path: '/usr/local/bin/nytprofhtml'

=head2 profdir

Where to store profiling data. Defaults to: C<$appdir/nytprof>

=head2 nytprofhtml_path

Path to the C<nytprofhtml> script that comes with L<Devel::NYTProf>. Defaults to
the first one we can find in your PATH environment. You should only  need to
change this in very specific environments, where C<nytprofhtml> can't be found by
this plugin.

=head2 enabled

Profiling comes with a penalty, and even in development environments you might
want to enable/disable it via configuration file. This lets you do so. You can
toggle this plugin by setting the C<enabled> option to 0 or 1. It is, of course,
enabled by default.

More configuration (such as the URL at which output is produced, and options to
control which requests get profiled) will be added in a future version.  (If
there's something you'd like to see soon, do contact me and let me know - it'll
likely get done a lot quicker then!)

# Need to load Devel::NYTProf at runtime after setting env var, as it will

# Dirty workaround: get a temp file, then let Devel::NYTProf use that, with
# addpid enabled so that it will append the PID too (so the filename won't
# exist), load Devel::NYTProf, then unlink the file.
