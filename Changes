Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-NYTProf

0.20    2012-01-31
        [ BUGFIXES ]
        * Load Devel::NYTProf at runtime, after setting the env vars to stop it
          beginning profiling immediately and giving it a temporary filename (as
          it insists on opening a file to write to /anyway/).
          This should solve problems where the plugin was unusable because
          Devel::NYTProf wanted to write a file to the appdir, even when the
          profdir setting was used.  Thanks to angel on IRC (#dancer) for
          reporting this problem.

        [ BUGFIXES ]
        * Check for presence of nytprofhtml, and check for errors executing it
          and produce helpful error messages 
          (PR-4 from Neil Hooey (nhooey) - thanks!)
        
        * Allow path to nytprofhtml to be configurable, default to finding it
          within the $PATH using File::Which

        * Don't crash if first request after starting app is to /nytprof and no
          profdir is set in config.

        [ SECURITY ]
        * Sanitise filenames from user properly.  Previously, it would have been
          possible to cause the module to send files outside the profdir with
          cleverly-crafted requests (hence the warnings in the documentation).
          Be careful that the filename received doesn't contain anything
          nefarious.

        Remove taint from test to avoid insecure dependency failures further
        down the line.

0.03    2011-11-03
        Use hook instead of before/after, which cause deprecation warnings now.

        Require Dancer >=  1.3060.
        (param() wasn't available before then, thanks to sukria for pointing
        this out)

0.01    2011-07-23
        Initial version.  Working, but plenty of room for improvement.
