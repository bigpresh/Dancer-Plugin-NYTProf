NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf - easy Devel::NYTProf profiling for Dancer apps

DESCRIPTION
    A plugin to provide easy profiling for Dancer applications, using the
    venerable Devel::NYTProf.

    By simply loading this plugin, you'll have the detailed, helpful
    profiling provided by Devel::NYTProf.

    Each individual request to your app is profiled. Going to the URL
    `/nytprof' in your app will present a list of profiles; selecting one
    will invoke `nytprofhtml' to generate the HTML reports (unless they
    already exist), then serve them up.

    WARNING This is an early version of this code which is still in
    development. In general this isn't a plugin I'd advise to use in a
    production environment anyway, but in particular, it uses `system' to
    execute `nytprofhtml', and I need to very carefully re-examine the code
    to make sure that user input cannot be used to nefarious effect. You are
    recommended to only use this in your development environment.
