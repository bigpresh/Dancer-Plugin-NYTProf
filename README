NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf - easy Devel::NYTProf profiling for Dancer apps

DESCRIPTION
    A plugin to provide easy profiling for Dancer applications, using the
    venerable Devel::NYTProf.

    By simply loading this plugin, you'll have the detailed, helpful
    profiling provided by Devel::NYTProf.

    Each individual request to your app is profiled. Going to the URL
    `/nytprof' in your app will present a list of profiles; selecting one
    will invoke `nytprofhtml' to generate the HTML reports (unless they
    already exist), then serve them up.

    WARNING This is an early version of this code which is still in
    development. In general this isn't a plugin I'd advise to use in a
    production environment anyway, but in particular, it uses `system' to
    execute `nytprofhtml', and I need to very carefully re-examine the code
    to make sure that user input cannot be used to nefarious effect. You are
    recommended to only use this in your development environment.

CONFIGURATION
    The plugin will work by default without any configuration required - it
    will default to writing profiling data into a dir named `profdir' within
    your Dancer application's `appdir', present profiling output at
    `/nytprof' (not yet configurable), and profile all requests.

    Below is an example of the options you can configure:

        plugins:
            NYTProf:
                profdir: '/tmp/profiledata'
                nytprofhtmlpath: '/usr/local/bin/nytprofhtml'

    More configuration (such as the URL at which output is produced, and
    options to control which requests get profiled) will be added in a
    future version. (If there's something you'd like to see soon, do contact
    me and let me know - it'll likely get done a lot quicker then!)
